**What is Requirement Analysis?**

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

**Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

**Clarity and Understanding:** It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.

**Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.

**Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.

**Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**

**1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è**
   
- Engage with stakeholders to collect initial requirements.

- Use various techniques like interviews, surveys, and workshops.

**3. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è**
   
- Refine and elaborate on the gathered requirements.
  
- Use techniques like brainstorming, focus groups, and prototyping.
  
**3. Requirement Documentation üìö**
   
- Document the requirements in a detailed and structured format.
  
- Use requirement specification documents, user stories, and use cases.
  
**4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä**
   
- Analyze and prioritize the requirements.
  
- Create models to visualize and understand the requirements.
  
**5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ**
   
- Review and validate the requirements with stakeholders.
  
- Define acceptance criteria and ensure traceability.

**Types of Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements**

**Definition:** Describe what the system should do.

**Examples:** User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.

- **Non-functional Requirements**
  
**Definition:** Describe how the system should perform.

**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.

**Use Case Diagrams**
  
**What are Use Case Diagrams?**

- Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).
  
**Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:**

- Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.

- Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.

- Facilitate communication among stakeholders and development team.

**Acceptance Criteria**

**Benefits of Acceptance Criteria:**

- Ensure all parties have a clear understanding of feature requirements.

- Provide a basis for testing and validation.

- Help in maintaining quality and meeting user expectations.

**Example for Checkout Feature:**

‚ÄúUsers should be able to review their selected services, enter payment details, complete the checkout process, and receive a payment confirmation message within 2 minutes.‚Äù
